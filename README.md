## Project Overview

This project provides a streamlined version of the Executive Security Dashboard that focuses on executive decision-making. It removes tactical details and consolidates related metrics to create a more focused view of the security posture.

## Key Improvements

1. **Added Key Insights Panel** - Provides immediate, actionable insights at the top of the dashboard
2. **Consolidated Charts** - Reduced the number of charts by combining related metrics
3. **Removed Tactical Details** - Eliminated charts that were too technical for executive consumption
4. **Added Recommendations** - Included a dedicated section for actionable security recommendations
5. **Streamlined Navigation** - Reorganized tabs for a more logical flow of information

## Removed Elements

Based on a careful review of the original dashboard, the following elements were removed or consolidated:

1. **Incident Classification Chart** - Too tactical for executives
2. **Alert Severity Distribution Chart** - Consolidated with Incidents by Severity
3. **Top Attack Techniques Chart** - Too technical for executive consumption
4. **Email-based Attack Analysis** - Too granular for executive review
5. **Separate Response and Resolution Time Charts** - Consolidated into a single Incident Handling Efficiency chart

## Design Principles

This streamlined dashboard follows these executive-focused design principles:

1. **Strategic Focus** - Emphasizes information needed for decision-making
2. **Actionable Insights** - Provides clear recommendations and highlights key issues
3. **Visual Clarity** - Uses consistent visual language and reduces clutter
4. **Business Context** - Connects security metrics to business impact
